# Microservice_using_reactive_programming
This project demonstrates how to build a microservices-based application using reactive programming principles. Instead of traditional blocking I/O, it leverages non-blocking, event-driven architecture to achieve high scalability and better resource utilization, making it ideal for modern cloud-native applications.
